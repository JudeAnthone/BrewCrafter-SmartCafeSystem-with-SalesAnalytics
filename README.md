# *BrewCrafter: Your Drink, Your Rules. A Smart Cafe System with Custom Drink Builder and Sales Analytics.*
This project is developed under the academic requirements for Information Management Systems. From the pressure of deadlines and the need for a unique approach, this project combines the convenience of modern cafe "SMART" ordering with the creativity of customizable drinks.<br>  

# *About the Project*
BrewCrafter: Your Drink, Your Rules is a full-stack smart caf√© management system developed as a capstone school project. The system was designed with a practical, real-world caf√© business in mind‚Äîparticularly targeting small to mid-sized establishments that face limitations due to manual workflows.

The system provides a complete digital ordering experience for customers through an interactive web-based client platform, and a admin dashboard for caf√© owners or staff to manage day-to-day operations efficiently. It allows customers to browse a dynamic menu, customize their drinks through a custom builder, and securely place orders‚Äîall with real-time pricing and cart management.

On the admin side, the system uses caf√© staff to manage menus, monitor inventory, view detailed customer orders, and generate sales analytics through visual charts. The platform uses modern technologies like React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication to ensure performance, security, and scalability.

*Key Objectives of the Project:*
- To replace manual caf√© operations with a centralized, automated system.
- To enhance customer engagement through personalized drink options.
- To provide caf√© managers with actionable insights via real-time analytics and inventory alerts.
- To implement secure authentication for both users and admins, including OTP verification and step-up security layers.
